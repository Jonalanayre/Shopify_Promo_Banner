# 🏷 Shopify Top Promo Banner 

A fully customizable **Top Promo Banner** section for Shopify themes.  
Built to solve the limitations of Shopify’s **native announcement bar**, this section adds **dynamic content, rich text, inline links, font controls, and optional images** — while keeping design clean and responsive.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Shopify’s default **announcement bar** is limited:
- Only supports a single plain text line.
- No **bold, italic, links, or inline formatting**.
- No control over **font sizes** or spacing.
- Lacks flexibility for adding **images, multiple lines, or styled calls-to-action**.

For merchants and developers who need **marketing flexibility** and **modern UI control**, these limitations slow down customization and require hacky workarounds.

## ✅ Solution
This **Top Promo Banner** section introduces:
- 🎨 **Rich Text Support** → Bold, italic, links, lists, and more for titles, sub-headlines, and optional third lines.
- 🔠 **Font Size Controls** → Adjustable sliders for each text line.
- 🔗 **Configurable Inline Links** → Add a styled inline link right next to your sub-headline.
- 🖼 **Optional Right-Aligned Image** → Perfect for icons, small logos, or product callouts.
- ⚡ **Responsive & Clean** → Built with Shopify’s Liquid + CSS grid, optimized for desktop and mobile.
